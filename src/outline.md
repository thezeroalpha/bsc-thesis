# Introduction
- why reliability is important
- specifically in filesystems
- what's done in this paper

# Background
- the programming language: C as the standard, alternatives, why Ada is a good choice
- formal verification: what it is, how it works (Hoare triples), why it's useful. any options for existing languages? what are the downsides?
- existing projects: fscq, others?
- fuse: what it is, why use it for development
- minix: why use this as example?

# Design & implementation
- filesystem design: what's similar to minix? what changes/compromises are made?
- language features: what's used here? how do we deal with lack of pointers?
- formal verification: how is this done, what contracts are used?

# Results
TODO: need to think of a way to evaluate the performance and bug-freeness
include formal verification results

# Conclusion
# Discussion
