\section{Results \& analysis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Include the formal verification report, what's verified in relation to CWE numbers.
  \item Add some performance analysis. Maybe timing? Try to do some common filesystem tasks \& see how it performs?
  \item An idea is to try to test the speed of operations, the key is to show what difference the formal verification makes in terms of runtime.
    % perhaps compare with this? https://github.com/redcap97/fuse-mfs
\end{itemize}
