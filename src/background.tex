\section{Background information}
\subsection{C as the implementation language}
The choice of an implementation language may affect the bugs or vulnerabilities that are present in the system.
The de-facto standard implementation language for operating systems and their components has long been C.
Many popular file systems are implemented in C, such as Ext4. \cite{ext4source}.
C is based on typeless languages, BCPL and B, which were developed specifically for operating system programming in early Unix.
A design principle of C was to be grounded in the operations and data types provided by the computer, while offering abstractions and portability to the programmer. \cite{ritchie1993}

Describe studies on issues with C, bugs found, CVEs, etc.

\subsection{Possible alternatives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Restricting C: MISRA-C, Frama-C
  \item Rust: esp. reference ownership
  \item D: allows functional contracts
  \item Coq: allows writing formal specification, proving it, and extracting certified program from constructive proof of its specification in OCaml, Haskell, or Scheme.
  \item Ada
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formal verification}
Explain what it is, particularly Hoare triples.
Why is it useful?

\subsection{FUSE}
Why use it for development, what are its limitations?
