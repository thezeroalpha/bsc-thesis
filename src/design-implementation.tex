\section{Design \& implementation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Filesystem design: why was MINIX chosen as the basis? Which parts of my filesystem are similar to MINIX? What changes/compromises are made?
  \item Language features: strong typing, lack of pointers (access types vs in-out parameters), modularisation using packages and private parts
  \item FUSE \& the FUSE driver
  \item Verification: contracts (functional and data). Also - what can't be verified (at the moment)?
\end{itemize}
