# BSc Thesis: AdaFS

This repository contains my Bachelor's thesis: formal verification of filesystems using Ada and SPARK.

Important files/directories:

* [Here is the final thesis I wrote.](thesis.pdf)
* [adafs/](adafs/): this submodule contains the code for AdaFS, a very minimal filesystem based on that of MINIX 2.
    You need to have [GNAT](https://www.adacore.com/download) installed, then you can follow the Makefile in the root of the submodule.
